# Flux Provenance Matrix

Internal engineering and compliance record for the Flux Platform V2 rearchitecture.

**Purpose.** This document records, per component, where the current Flux
distribution stands relative to its origins so that license obligations are met
while derived material remains, and so that attribution is retired only after a
component is genuinely reimplemented. It is the authoritative source referenced
by [`NOTICE.md`](../NOTICE.md).

**What this file is not.** It does not reproduce third-party source. It records
provenance *conclusions*, not comparison dumps or copied excerpts.

## Classification legend

| Category | Meaning | Default action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Independently written; not materially derived from Encore | Retain; test; document ownership |
| **B** | Generic/commonplace infrastructure | Evaluate normally; do not rewrite for artificial difference |
| **C** | Materially derived from / adapted from Encore Tweaks | Keep attribution; replace with independent implementation; remove legacy path after validation |
| **D** | Uncertain provenance | Treat conservatively as derived; preserve any header; resolve or replace before stable release |
| **E** | Third-party dependency consumed intentionally | Preserve license; pin version; do not modify vendored code |

## External reference-only material (Category E — reference, not consumed)

The following third-party projects are recorded for architectural risk
assessment only. **No source, asset, transaction list, class structure,
protocol, naming, or lifecycle from them may enter Flux** without explicit
licensing review and user approval. They are not dependencies and are not
distributed with Flux.

| Reference | What it is | Category | Flux position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Encore `binder_resolver` (https://github.com/Rem01Gaming/binder_resolver) | Standalone resolver that maps Binder Stub transaction field names to integer codes at runtime | E — reference-only | Not imported. Flux's own event-source design (see [`adr/0001-process-event-source.md`](adr/0001-process-event-source.md)) is written independently from AOSP behavior and public Binder docs. Any Flux `BinderContractProbe` is independently designed with an allowlist, validation, checksum/version metadata, and per-API fixtures. |
| Encore native Binder Monitor / BinderNDK work | Native Binder-based process/foreground monitoring in the Encore daemon | E — reference-only | Not copied. Flux's `ProcessEventSource`/`AndroidBinderTransport` is an independent design; Flux does not mirror its component hierarchy, protocol, or naming. |

SynthesisCore's long-term responsibility is deliberately **narrowed** to
device/sensor telemetry (thermal, Android thermal status, power saver, charging,
screen, audio, integer zen mode) plus a foreground *fallback*. Foreground /
process-lifecycle detection moves to the Flux-native `ProcessEventSource` in a
later phase. SynthesisCore must not become a monolithic process-monitoring or
policy service. See ADR 0001.

## Open compliance items (must close before declaring V2 independence)

1. ~~**Google Sans Flex** — unresolved redistribution license.~~ **Resolved:**
   font assets and `@font-face` rules removed; WebUI uses a system-first font
   stack and bundles no typeface (rebuilt `dist` verified font-free).
2. ~~**`jni/base/LockFile`** — provenance-unresolved (Category B/D).~~
   **Resolved:** replaced with an independent Flux implementation built on Linux
   OFD locks (`fcntl(F_OFD_SETLK)`), with an Apache-2.0/Flux header and host
   tests. See the LockFile row above.
3. All **Category C** components still ship under Apache-2.0 with Encore
   attribution. Attribution is retired *per component* only after independent
   reimplementation is validated and no derived code/assets/structure/expression
   remains — never merely because a file was renamed or partially rewritten.

## Attribution-retirement rule

For any Category C/D component, before removing its Encore attribution:

- the replacement is independently designed against the Flux V2 specification
  (not a line-by-line transform);
- behavior parity is proven by tests;
- the legacy runtime path is removed;
- a similarity check confirms no distinctive Encore expression remains.

Only then is the attribution removed from *that component*, and NOTICE.md
updated accordingly.
