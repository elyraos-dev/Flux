# Prove the V2 execution path is live and the legacy shell apply path is not.
#
# The cutover's whole claim is "there is exactly one thing that writes to this device". That is
# not something a reviewer can confirm by reading a diff, and it is not something grep can
# confirm either — grep sees a string in a comment and a call to a function that no longer
# exists and cannot tell them apart from the real thing.
#
# So this checks the *built binary*: what it links, what it calls, and what strings it carries.
# A stale object file, a resurrected fallback, or a well-meant "just this once" shell call all
# fail here rather than in someone's hands.
#
# Layers:
#   1. the daemon links the V2 execution engine (symbol proof)
#   2. the daemon contains no flux_profiler invocation (string proof)
#   3. the daemon calls no shell-execution libc entry point (relocation/symbol proof)
#   4. there is exactly one apply entry point in the source (call-graph proof)
#   5. there is exactly one zen write entry point
#   6. the packaged module still ships what it claims to
