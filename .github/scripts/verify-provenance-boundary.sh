# Enforce the Category A / Category C boundary in CI.
#
# The whole reason Flux can keep an independent execution engine while still shipping
# Encore-derived device knowledge is that the two live in different places and obey different
# rules:
#
#   jni/engine/execution/  Category A — Flux-authored mechanism. Writes to devices.
#   jni/device/            Category C — derived knowledge. Declarative data. Never writes.
#
# That boundary is a licensing position, not a style preference. If device tables ever start
# containing control flow, the engine's independence claim collapses along with it — so this
# check fails the build rather than a review.
#
# Host tests already assert this from the inside (the descriptors themselves carry no
# executable content). This asserts it from the outside, at the file level, where a new
# contributor is most likely to get it wrong by adding "just one helper".
