# Build and run the Flux host test suite.
#
# These tests compile the *production* parser, policy and inotify watcher sources with a host
# compiler and exercise them against the real Linux kernel. inotify is a kernel facility, so
# the atomic-rename path SynthesisCore uses can be tested here for real rather than mocked.
#
# The Android daemon itself still needs the NDK; this suite deliberately covers only the parts
# that carry the safety logic, which is also the part that had the bugs.
#
# Usage:
#   jni/tests/run_tests.sh            # build and run
#   CXX=clang++ jni/tests/run_tests.sh
#   SANITIZE=1 jni/tests/run_tests.sh # with ASan + UBSan
